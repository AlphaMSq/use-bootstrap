          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to
          demonstrate the
          <code>flush</code>
          attribute. This is the first item's accordion body.

          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to
          demonstrate the
          <code>flush</code>
          attribute. This is the second item's accordion body. Let's imagine
          this being filled with some actual content.

        <AccordionBody>
          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to
          demonstrate the
          <code>flush</code>
          attribute. This is the third item's accordion body. Nothing more
          exciting happening here in terms of content, but just filling up the
          space to make it look, at least at first glance, a bit more
          representative of how this would look in a real-world application.
